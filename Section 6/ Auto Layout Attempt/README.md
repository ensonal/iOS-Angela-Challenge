# Section 6 - Auto Layout Attempt

## My Goal

At the moment, my app only looks good on the canvas dimension that I've selected. If I run the app on screens with different aspect ratios or try to turn it to landscape, the designs will look broken. 

Auto Layout allows me to set rules as to how I want my views to be displayed. Because mobile screens have different resolutions and sizes, I need these rules to tell the iPhone/iPad how it should layout all the elements in the storyboard onto the display. These rules allow my UI elements to be resized and positioned so that no matter which screen they are displayed on, they always look as the designer intended.


## What I Learned

* How to add constraints and understanding how Auto Layout works.
* How to Pin and Align elements.
* How to create containers to configure advanced layouts.
* How to debug auto layout errors.
* Understanding what Xcode needs in order to correctly layout a design.
* How to use Stack Views to create complex interfaces.

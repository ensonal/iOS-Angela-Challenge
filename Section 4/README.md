## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I builded in the future. This app teached me a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.


## What I Learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
